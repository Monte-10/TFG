The intersection between sports and nutrition is fundamental for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. However, many people face difficulties in integrating healthy practices into their daily routine due to a lack of time and specific knowledge. One way to address this is by hiring a specialist, but due to its high cost, this possibility is not accessible to everyone. This challenge often leads to the adoption of generic diets or inadequate exercise routines, which increases the risk of negative outcomes and injuries. The main barrier to adopting a healthy lifestyle lies in the lack of relevant and accessible information, as well as the limitation of time to acquire such knowledge.

Recognizing this need, my Final Degree Project (TFG) focuses on simplifying access to personalized nutrition and exercise plans. The goal is to provide users, regardless of their previous experience in sports, with the necessary tools to improve their performance or start a journey towards physical well-being, thus avoiding erroneous practices.

As a solution, FitFuelBalance has been developed, a platform that offers services in both web and mobile application formats. This application allows users to request personalized services from trainers and nutritionists, who can use a repository of predefined exercises and diets to create tailored plans. Users have the ability to review details and request adjustments to their routines from professionals through the application, thus ensuring a personalized and efficient experience.

The project has generated great interest among different user profiles, from sports experts to individuals with no prior experience, as well as people dedicated to training or nutrition, demonstrating the potential of technology to transform the way people access and manage their health and well-being. This document will detail the analysis, design, coding, testing, and implementation of the FitFuelBalance platform, aimed at individuals seeking to improve their health and physical performance efficiently and personalized.
