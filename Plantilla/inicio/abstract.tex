The intersection between sports and nutrition is fundamental to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. However, many individuals struggle to integrate healthy practices into their daily routines due to a lack of time and specific knowledge. This challenge often leads to the adoption of generic diets or inadequate exercise routines, increasing the risk of negative outcomes and injuries. The main barrier to adopting a healthy lifestyle lies in the lack of relevant and accessible information, as well as the limited time to acquire such knowledge.

Recognizing this need, my Final Degree Project (TFG) focuses on simplifying access to personalized nutrition and exercise plans. The aim is to provide users, regardless of their prior sports experience, with the necessary tools to improve their performance or embark on a journey towards physical well-being, without requiring significant time investment in self-learning or incorrect practices.

As a solution, I have developed FitFuelBalance, an integrated platform offering services both as a web and mobile application. This application allows users to request personalized services from trainers and nutritionists, who can use a repository of predefined exercises and diets to create tailored plans. Users have the ability to review details and request adjustments to their routines from professionals through the application, ensuring a personalized and efficient experience. Additionally, the use of artificial intelligence is incorporated to facilitate instant recommendations and adaptations, enhancing the personalization of the plans offered.

The project has garnered significant interest among various user profiles, from sports experts to individuals with no prior experience, as well as those dedicated to training or nutrition, demonstrating the potential of technology to transform how people access and manage their health and well-being. This document will detail the analysis, design, coding, testing, and implementation of the FitFuelBalance platform, aimed at businesses, institutions, and individuals seeking to improve their health and physical performance efficiently and personally.
